Welcome.
This website is a collection of my professional work, including research work, teaching, publications, and presentations.


About Me
------
My interests lie in mathematics, biological physics, and college-level education. I love puzzles and codes and hope to one day find new information that connects DNA, RNA, and amino acid residue sequences to physical confirmational states. 


My professional journey started at Appalachian State University in Boone, NC, where I fell in love with physics and chemistry. 
While others were interested in astronomy or engineering, I was interested in understanding the molecular world.
I went to Rutgers University-New Brunswick for my graduate studies, first working biophysical characterization of collagen mutations.
Not satisified with a purely experimental role, I found a home in the Olson Biopolymers Lab working on computational biophysics of DNA.


After my dissertation, I took an Assistant Clinical Professor position at University of Maryland- College Park in 2023, teaching first-year undergraduates the basics of research and introduced some strucutral bioinformatics research.
In 2024 I took a post-doctoral research position under Dr. Sebastian Sensale-Rodriquez in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Cleveland State University studying DNA origami and circular DNA fragments.
